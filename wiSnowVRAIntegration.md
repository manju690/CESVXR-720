# Introduction

Blueprinting service Catalog item in a vRA service broker lets end user
easily deploy virtual server in required cloud endpoint (DHC, Azure,
Etc).

# Purpose

How integrate Servicenow from VRA to Create RITM in service now using vRA.

# Audience

This document is intended for Developer or End users who are responsible
to edit/configure anthing in service now using VRA Event.

# Scope

The scope of this document covers the following:

  - Select a specific vRA event Topic such as ***Restart VM***, ***Delete Deployment***, ***Provision the VM*** etc.

  - Create a VRO workflow to log the request in service now.

  - create an RITM and close the RITM once Event is done. 


# Process  
1. **Get the required access of VRA and Service now to create a RITM.**
	> Verify the access of both the Tools.
3. **List out the API to Create the request.** 
 	> To Create a RITM In Service Now, we have used below api.

 ![djsfjdsf](./images/Vro Login.JPG)
	  
		3. Add a resthost by Navigating Library -> Workflow -> Library -> Http-Rest -> Configurtion -> Add a Resthost.
		4. Click on add Resthost.
		5. Click on Run

		NOTE:  while adding Host URL,add only baseUrl. for eg: https://atosglobaldev.service-now.com/ is the base url.
        
 4. ***Create a worokflow***
 
 	* This workflow will be called after an event will be trigger from VRA.    
    * To create workflow Navigate to Workflow, under workflow select a folder or create a new folder for eg DHC then create a workflow under that folder using create New workflow.
    * Give the meaningful name of workflow then click on create button.
    * Define varible which will be used in workflow for eg Rest-Host.
    * To define new variable select variable tab and click on new button. After clicking on new button,new dialogue button will open.
    * give the varible name for eg "snowHost".
    * select the type of variable for eg: "RestHost".
    * select the rest host that we have added using add restHost Properties.
    * click on create button.
    * Navigate to Schema Section.drag a scrible task object from left menu in the middle of start and end workflow object.
    * Under gemeral table go to input/output section and select defined variable as a input. to select this click on plus '+' button. and then click on select variable button then select that variable.
    * Go to under script sectio then write required code under this tab. 
    * Once code is written then select click on "RUN".
   
5. ***Configure this workflow in VRA***
	* To Configure workflow in VRA, we need to create a Subscription and then attach in vro workflow in it.
	* Navigate to Extensiblity -> Subscription -> New Subscription.
	* Give the subscription name, select the event topic, select the workflow that we have created in VRO. 
	* if we need to filter any event the we can add condtion as well. to add condition we can use metadata. for eg event.data.oepration == "Reboot" will make this workflow execute only when we will reboot any VMs.
    * NOTE: If we make this subscription is blocking, While executing this workflow other workflow will not be executed until it finishes.
    
6. ***Testing the Workflow***
	* To test the workflow we need to restart the any vm then we will see that event gets trigged and workflow executed succcessfully.
	* To see the worflow runs, navigate to Activity -> workflow Runs. then click on the workflow run id to see the execution details. 
	* Also, we can verify in SNOW portal using RITM that we have got in the log of workflow.
